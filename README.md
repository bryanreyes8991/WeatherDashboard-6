# WEATHER DASHBOARD 
## OVERVIEW

This application is intended to apply the use of fetching server request from an API & displaying the ability to dynamically update the given context as recent. We can accomplish many of the necessary feats with our built in Javascript methods. These allow us many useful tools from parsing JSON to easily request data and return responses. Along with some CSS and some logic we can create something simple but wonderful. Working with this API was tedious. There were many times when I would go through the documentation & not fully comprehend the material.
